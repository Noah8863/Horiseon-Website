# Horiseon-Website

## Description about the project

This program cleans up and fixes a lot of semantic issues the Horiseon Online Marketing website had. The original code was given by DU Bootcamp to help teach about HTML and CSS. 

## Main take aways from the project

I learned about how to structure HTML tags and how to use accessibility elements that I can use in my source code. I also learned how to link pictures and other code in different folders that aren't in the main file.
